\f0\b\fs22 \cf0 ESTmapper Documentation v1.0\

\f1\b0 03/16/2007\

\f0\b \
\
I. What is ESTmapper?\
\

\f1\b0 ESTmapper is a software package for the high-throughput alignment of large cDNA (EST, mRNA) sequence sets to a large eukaryotic genome of the same species. It can also be used to map relatively short DNA segments, such as sequencing reads or SNP flanking sequences, to the genome.\
\
\

\f0\b II. How does ESTmapper work?\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sb60\sa60\ql\qnatural

\f1\b0 \cf0 For each cDNA in the input set, ESTmapper detects one or several occurrences of the cDNA in the target genome. ESTmapper uses a three-stage process to locate a cDNA sequence in the genome:\
\pard\pardeftab720\li900\fi-900\sb120\sa60\ql\qnatural

\f0\b \cf0 Stage 0:
\f1\b0  
\f2\i Configuration
\f1\i0  \'d0 examine the genomic sequences and pre-compute search indices.  This needs to be done once per genome.\

\f0\b Stage 1:
\f1\b0  
\f2\i Signal finding
\f1\i0  \'d0 uses an efficient sequence similarity search to identify regions on the genome potentially containing the cDNA (
\f2\i signals
\f1\i0 );\
\pard\pardeftab720\li900\fi-900\sb60\sa60\ql\qnatural

\f0\b \cf0 Stage 2:
\f1\b0  
\f2\i Signal filtering
\f1\i0  \'d0 discards regions containing weak signals based on the extent of the cDNA matched and the number of candidate regions; \

\f0\b Stage 3:
\f1\b0  
\f2\i Signal polishing
\f1\i0  \'d0 generates a spliced alignment between the cDNA and each of the genomic regions selected earlier.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
\

\f0\b IIIa. Basic usage (configuration)\
\

\f1\b0 The first step is to pre-process the genomic sequences, using the configureESTmapper.pl program.\
\
There are two required parameters:\
\pard\pardeftab720\li3600\fi-3600\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-genome g.fasta		the genome to map to\
	-genomedir genome-directory	the directory to save the configuration in\
\
And numerous optional parameters:\
	-mersize m			use m-mers (default 20)\
	-merskip s			skip s m-mers between mers (default 0, use all mers)\
	-memory M			use M MB memory for the search processes (default 1000MB)\
	-segment S			use S search processed (default, decided on memory size)\
	-sge				compute the configuration on the grid; args are passed to qsub\
	-sgename			sge job name (default 'EMconfig')\
	-local				compute the configuration right now (the default)\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
This will build an index into the genomic sequences 
\f2\i g.fasta
\f1\i0  allowing fast access to each sequence.  It will segment the sequences into equal sized pieces, either sized so that the search processes are expected to run in 
\f2\i M
\f1\i0 MB of memory, or into 
\f2\i S
\f1\i0  pieces.  A rule of thumb is that each base will need 10 bytes of memory; mamallian genomes comfortably fit in 
\f2\i S
\f1\i0 =32 pieces.\
\
The mersize 
\f2\i m
\f1\i0  and merskip 
\f2\i s
\f1\i0  roughly control the space/time/sensitivity of the search process.  Smaller mersizes require more time to find signals, generate more false positives (more space to store results, much more time to polish).  Larger merskips quickly reduce memory requirements (
\f2\i s
\f1\i0 =1 decreases the number of mers by 50%) which can reduce sensitivity, but doesn't impact search time much.\
\
Example:\
\
Configure the 
\f2\i Apis mellifera
\f1\i0  genome for ESTmapper, using the default 
\f2\i m
\f1\i0 =20 mersize and 
\f2\i s
\f1\i0 =0 merskip.  Request four segments, instead of limiting each segment to a specific memory size.  Perform the configuration computations using SGE, passing some SGE-specific options to the submission command.\

\f0\b \cf0 \
IIIb. Basic usage (mapping)\

\f1\b0 \
Once a genome is configured, any number of ESTmapper mappings can be performed, on any input cDNA, EST or short genomic region input set.\
\
There are three required parameters:\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-outputdir		mapping-directory, the output and temporary files will go here.\
	-genomedir		genome-directory, as configured with configureESTmapper.pl.\
	-mapX			mapping style; -mapest, -mapmrna or -mapsnp.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
There are numerous optional parameters, grouped by ESTmapper phase:\
\
[global]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-runlater		prepare the computations (search, filter, polish) but do not actually compute them.  Instead, tell the user what to do.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
[SGE options]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-sge N			run ESTmapper using SGE, with name N.\
	-sgeoptions "O"	"O" is supplied to all SGE submit commands.\
	-sgesearch "O"	"O" is supplied to search phase SGE submit commands.\
	-sgefilter "O"		"O" is supplied to filter phase SGE submit commands.\
	-sgepolish "O"		"O" is supplied to polish phase SGE submit commands.\
	-sgefinish "O"		"O" is supplied to finish phase SGE submit commands.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
A note about SGE options:  It is very important to quote the options to these parameters, otherwise, ESTmapper will attempt to interpret them.  For example:  -sgepolish "-q idle.q -p -10".\
\
[searching phase]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-localsearches N	compute the search phase locally, on this machine, running 
\f2\i N
\f1\i0  processes at the same time.\
	-searchthreads T	use 
\f2\i T
\f1\i0  compute threads per search process.\
	-mermaskfile M.fasta	read 
\f2\i M.fasta
\f1\i0 , and ignore any mer present there when searching for signal.\
	-merignore n	ignore any mers that occur n times or more in the genome.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
[filtering options]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-hitsortmemory M	use 
\f2\i M
\f1\i0 MB memory to sort hits.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-nofilter		do no filtering of hits.\
\
[polishing phase]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li3600\fi-3600\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-min[sim4]coverage C		report [make sim4 look for] alignments that cover at least C% of the query.  Default C=50.\
	-min[sim4]identity I		report [make sim4 look for] alignments that are at least I% identity.  Default I=95.\
	-min[sim4]length L		report [make sim4 look for] alignments that are at least L bases long.  Default L=0.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-relink R		Sim4 \'d4relink\'d5 constant, to allow for large introns. The default values are 500 for ESTs and 1000 for mRNAs.\
	-alwaysprint A		always report A alignments per query, regardless of quality.\
	-batchsize B		run polishing in batches of B signals each.\
	-numbatches N	run polishing using N batches of signals.\
	-localpolishes N	run polishing locally, on this machine, running N processes at the same time.\
	-interspecies		attempt to align between closely-related species.\
	-[no]aligns		[do not] save alignments in the output.\
	-abort			abort alignments that look suspicions and are expensive.\
	-yn			save the answer for each signal processed (for debugging).\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
Usually, the [sim4] flavor of the -min* options are unnecessary.  By default, sim4 will look for alignments 5% below what is specified, e.g., "-mincoverage 50" implies "-minsim4coverage 45".\
\
If any -min option is supplied, it is better to supply all three.  Supplying just "-minlength 100" will leave the default values of "-mincoverage 50" and "-minidentity 95"; especially -mincoverage is probably not desired in this case.\
\
[termination phase]\
\pard\pardeftab720\li2880\fi-2880\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	-[no]cleanup		[do not] attempt to cleanup the results, removing small spurious exons, among other things\
	-savetemporary	save all the gory intermediate files\

\cf0 polishes-good
\f2\i 		
\f1\i0 all cDNA-genomic alignments that meet the specified quality criteria\
polishes-best
\f2\i 		
\f1\i0 for each EST, only the \'d5best\'d5 genomic alignment among those that meet  the specified quality criteria (if multiple alignments with the same \'d4best\'d5 characteristics exist, then all are reported)\
\
summary		summary mapping statistics for the run\
\pard\tx1800\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 The following associated sequence files will also be created:\

This is the same match as in example 1. The edef line now characterizes the cDNA sequence (i.e., the RefSeq sequence corresponding to the opsin 3 gene mRNA), and the ddef line characterizes the genomic sequence (i.e., human chromosome 1). \
\
The alignment contains one substitution (C-A) at position 3 in exon 2.\
\
c. ESTmapper creates several 
\f2\i intermediate
\f1\i0  data files located in the designated working directory as follows:\
\
0-input 	symbolic links to input files, indices and other temporary files\
1-search	temporary directory for Stage I (signal finding)\
2-filter		temporary directory for Stage II (signal filtering)\
3-polish	temporary directory for Stage III (alignment and validation)\
\
\
\

\f0\b V. Software and hardware requirements\
\

\f1\b0 ESTmapper is written in a combination of Perl and C++, and should run on any Posix compliant unix-like platform.  For large tasks, such as mapping 6M EST sequences to the human genome, at least 1GB RAM and up to 80GB disk for intermediate results is required; the output will be approximately 12 GB (9 GB for \'d4polishes-good\'d5, 3 GB for \'d4polishes-best\'d5).\
\
ESTmapper was designed, developed and implemented by Brian Walenz (brianwalenz@sourceforge.net) and Liliana Florea (floreald@sourceforge.net).\
