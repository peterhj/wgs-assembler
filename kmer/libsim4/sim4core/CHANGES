Test for overlapping exons in sim4string.C.  If SHOW_OVERLAPPING_EXONS
is defined, they will be printed to stderr.


Mon Apr 29 03:57:10 EDT 2002 (build 2333)
Added '-V' option to print script lines as they are processed.
Changed the wording of the status ('-v') output.

Added -forcestrand to force the strand prediction to always be
'forward' or 'reverse'.  Changes to sim4string.C/run() and
util.C/slide_intron(), and sim4db.H.  Added
dbParams._forceStrandPrediction flag to enable/disable this behavior.

Fixed sync_slide_intron to increase the limit of Glist, Clist and oris
from 200 exons to anything.  titin mapped to ncbi human genome had
more than 200 exons.

Wed Aug 28 14:03:50 EDT 2002
Fixed get_stats() to _not_ check/reset the strand prediction when
-forcestrand is in effect. In addition, fixed run() to set the 
orientation of 'unknown' matches to FWD first. For complement matches,
this will later become BWD.
